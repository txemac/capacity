# Confidential ML Model Distribution PoC

## Summary
Design and implement a proof-of-concept for a confidential LLM model delivery pipeline. The
task has three progressive layers: Layer 1 is required and Layer 2 and 3 are optional. All layers
share the same two-part structure: a Producer that encrypts and publishes a model, and a
Consumer that retrieves and decrypts it. No confidential hardware is required at any layer.

## Layer 1 (Required): Encrypted Model Distribution in Kubernetes
Implement a basic confidential model delivery pipeline running in a Kubernetes environment.

### Producer
1. Select a small open model from Hugging Face (e.g. a small BERT).
2. Encrypt the model (free to choose any tool/library).
3. Push the encrypted artifact to Hugging Face Hub.
4. Store the decryption key as a Kubernetes Secret, accessible to the consumer workload.
### Consumer
1. Deploy a Kubernetes pod that mounts the decryption key from the Kubernetes Secret.
2. Download the encrypted artifact from Hugging Face Hub.
3. Decrypt the model using the key.
4. Load the model.

## Layer 2 (Optional): Model Signing & Verification
Extend Layer 1 by adding a signing step to the producer and a verification step to the consumer,
ensuring the model artifact was not tampered with between publication and use.

### Additional steps on top of Layer 1:
1. Generate an asymmetric key pair (free to choose any tool/library).
2. Sign the encrypted artifact with the private key during the producer phase.
3. Publish the signature alongside the artifact.
4. In the consumer, verify the signature using the public key before decryption takes place
(abort if verification fails).

## Layer 3 (Optional): Attested Key Release via Kata+CoCo
Extend the pipeline by replacing the Kubernetes Secret with attested key retrieval using
Confidential Containers in development mode. The consumer no longer trusts the host for key
delivery, so the decryption key is only released after an attestation. This layer can be
implemented on top of Layer 1 alone or combined with Layer 2 for the full confidential pipeline
(encrypt + sign + attest).

### Additional steps on top of Layer 1:
1. Deploy the CoCo operator and Trustee KBS on the cluster using the
“kata-qemu-coco-dev” runtime class.
2. Store the decryption key in KBS via “kbs-client set-resource” under a defined resource
path (e.g. default/key/my-model) instead of a Kubernetes Secret.
3. Configure a permissive resource policy in KBS allowing key release to sample TEE
attestation.
4. Run the consumer pod with the KBS address configured via the “agent.aa_kbc_params” parameter annotation.
5. Fetch the decryption key from KBS through the Confidential Data Hub (CDH) endpoint at
127.0.0.1:8006/cdh/resource/..., relying on the full attestation flow.

## General Notes:
● Layers 2 and 3 are independent: a candidate may implement Layer 1 + Layer 3 (attested
delivery without signing) or Layer 1 + Layer 2 + Layer 3 (the full stack).
● The choice of model, encryption library, and tooling is left to the candidate (justification
might be asked during the discussion of the solution).

## Deliverables
A public Git repository containing:
● Dockerfiles for the producer and consumer workloads.
● Kubernetes manifests for all workloads (Pods, Secrets, or any other resources used).
● A README covering prerequisites, how to build and deploy the full pipeline, and how to
verify each layer works.
